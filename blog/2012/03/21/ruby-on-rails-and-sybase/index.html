<div class="entry-content"><p>This was my notes many years ago of getting Ruby on Rails to run on Sybase.
It is no doubt out-of-date by now. But still an interesting read for me, kind of like reading an old diary.</p>

<hr />

<p>I have been trying to learn how to get Rails to work with Sybase for a while because Sybase is predominantly the database at my work.</p>

<p>Since I am not exactly free nor allowed to spend chunks of my time working on this stuff at work I haven&#8217;t had much success. For some reason, there isn&#8217;t as much resource on getting Rails to work with Sybase compared to MySQL or PosgreSQL.</p>

<p>So every now and then I&#8217;d research a bit to see if anything new in the field comes up that might help. On one such research I found http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/HowToSetupSybaseAdapterOnRails on Sybase Rails wiki http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/Sybase. It is the instructions for Suse 7.3, and during my research I learn that I can install <a href="http://www.sybase.com/partner/mac">Sybase on OS X</a> so I thought it was worth to give the instructions a try.</p>

<p>Overall the process wasn&#8217;t too bad, I skipped step 4 &amp; 5 (but later I had to setup SYBASE environment, something complained about it). Also was quite lucky the extconfig.rb (step 7) in <a href="http://raa.ruby-lang.org/project/sybase-ctlib/">Ruby Sybase Library</a> already contains a commented out section for OS X configuration (it was written for Panther but it worked for me on Tiger). I can&#8217;t remember for sure if step 7 was when I was faced with the problem of missing libraries but either way I was able to find the missing library name and <a href="http://www.omnis.net/technotes/tnsq0009.html">got the answer</a> (I picked the Symbolic Links solution).</p>

<pre><code>cd /usr/libsudo 
ln -s /Applications/Sybase/System/OCS-12_5/lib/libsybtcl.dylib libsybtcl.dylibsudo
ln -s /Applications/Sybase/System/OCS-12_5/lib/libsybdb.dylib libsybdb.dylibsudo 
ln -s /Applications/Sybase/System/OCS-12_5/lib/libsybintl.dylib libsybintl.dylibsudo 
ln -s /Applications/Sybase/System/OCS-12_5/lib/libsybct.dylib libsybct.dylibsudo 
ln -s /Applications/Sybase/System/OCS-12_5/lib/libsybcs.dylib libsybcs.dylibsudo 
ln -s /Applications/Sybase/System/OCS-12_5/lib/libsybcomn.dylib libsybcomn.dylib
</code></pre>

<p>After step 7 (create Makefile &amp; compile by running make) I tested Ruby Sybase Library in the local folder by running sqlsample.rb against Sybase and it all worked so things were looking promising.</p>

<p>However step 8 expects step 7 to have created 4 files which are to be installed in system directory (any ruby load path). But since it had already passed the test I didn&#8217;t think too much of it and just copied the only 3 out of 4 files that I could find, created a new project (running on edge rails) configure database.yml to run against sybase adapter then test it using script/console. Unfortunately that wasn&#8217;t enough. What made it worse was that the error message was really not helpful because it said &#8220;database configuration specifies nonexistent sybase adapter&#8221;, by running console with &#8211;trace I found the line that raised the error and the condition that caused the error. I was still confused after I found the line because it was testing if the class has a method called sybase_connection, which I knew for sure existed in sybase_adapter.rb. After a while I finally noticed that sybase_adapter.rb starts a begin block then require &#8216;sybsql&#8217; (which is one of the 3 files I installed) and that require statement is throwing an error which is rescued right at the end of the file and the catch block doesn&#8217;t do anything (no logging of any sort). So after I modified it to printed out the error, I finally found out the real reason why sybase adapter isn&#8217;t loaded properly.</p>

<p>The error turned out to be &#8220;unable to load sybct.o&#8221;. The error seems strange because I already tested the library with sqlsample.rb so something that was in the local library directory when running sqlsample.rb is also needed to be installed in system directory. A couple of trial and error the 4th file that is needed turns out to be sybct.bundle. After installing that file I finally got rails to run on Sybase, wahoo!!!</p>

<p>I grew a bit more comfortable about ActiveRecord during this experience, get to install Sybase locally (so I&#8217;ll get a chance to learn about Sybase admin functions) and get a little bit closer to getting Rails to work with Sybase at work :)</p>
