<p>After Steelpixel transferred my hosting plan over to Railsplayground, I still have hosting up to end of 2009.</p>

<p>I haven't been using it since the rollover and I am getting tempted to start using it again. Tumblr has been serving me well but there are some features that I would like, e.g. tagging. If I am using my own host then I will have more control. I can even reinstate my SoloWiki.</p>

<p>A couple of reasons why I haven't done it, a) I can't stand another downtime with shenie.info and b) when Steelpixel went down I was saying to myself I don't need the hassle of running my own shit.</p>

<p>I must be getting itchy hands again.</p>
