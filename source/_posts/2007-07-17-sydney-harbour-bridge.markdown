<p>I had the pleasure of walking across Sydney harbour bridge, but it wasn't by choice, I was forced to walk in order to get to work because the train broke down at the last station before the bridge. Coincidentally today was the coldest day in the history of Sydney since 1950. You can always count on CityRail failing when it is raining, I guess it can't deal with cold temperature as well :)</p>
