<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2008/04/30/PDML-Twitter-Mashup">Tim's post</a> which reminded me that I had implemented similar things with Romey. Basically because I was running Romey on a Mac Mini at home and didn't want to make it accessible over the internet I created another way to create transactions in Romey. It was done with a POP account at my ISP, ruby script running by cron on the Mac Mini. I stopped running the cron job since I changed ISD but having read Tim's post I am thinking about reactivating the service again and extending it to involve Twitter as well. I already have written ruby scripts that post updates to Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/myfinance">this</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/railsrumblerank">this</a>) before. I think it'll be cool if Romey could post to twitter when certain condition is triggered, e.g. going over budget.</p>

<p>After that I just need to have a mobile phone plan with internet then I can create Romey transactions anyway by sending an email and receive notifications from Romey via Twitter.</p>
