<p>I am sick of downloading all the java libraries myself so I was hoping I could automate it using a tool.</p>

<p>So I looked into Maven, and I gave up after approx. 30 mins because for a lot of the libraries I wanted, Maven didn't download the source for it so I'd still need to find it myself...</p>

<p>This is so much more hassle to maintain a local repository for jars and source compare to rubygem.</p>

<p>Maybe will have another crack some other time.</p>
