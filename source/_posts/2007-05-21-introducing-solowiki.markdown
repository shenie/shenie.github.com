<p>I am hooked on the speed of SoloWiki, OSS version of ServerSideWiki (after it is loaded). But I have been doing a bit of research for an alternative because I am a bit concerned that it hasn't got updates since it was released. Unfortunately nothing really matches what I want out of my wikis.</p>
