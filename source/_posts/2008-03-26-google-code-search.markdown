<p>Checked out <a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/WhatsNew">what's new</a> with Google Code and discovered this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We've always valued clean URLs for project home pages, and have used <a href="http://code.google.com/p/PROJECTNAME">http://code.google.com/p/PROJECTNAME</a> since we started offering project hosting. Now, projects can also be reached via an even cleaner URL: <a href="http://PROJECTNAME.googlecode.com">http://PROJECTNAME.googlecode.com</a>.</p>

<p>Sweet, I've just been using google search which worked well enough but now I don't have too.</p>

<p>I am ashamed that it has already been around since July last year and I didn't discover it until now.</p>
