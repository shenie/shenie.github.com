<p>I am disappointed at Super Monkey Ball: Banana Blitz. It was much easier for me to start enjoy Rayman Raving Rabbids than the monkey. One major problem is that the instruction for controls of each mini game is too hard to understand. Also there are too many moments in the game that is boring yet you cannot skip them. The story mode is not too bad. Haven't had a chance of going through ALL the mini games, too many of them, a bit overwhelming..</p>
