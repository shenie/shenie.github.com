Please be aware our support ticketing system arranges enquiries we receive by date. We respond to the oldest enquiries first. Each new response you submit, updates the date of your ticket. To ensure you receive a response as quickly as possible, please do not reply to your original support request until you have received a response from our staff. We also request that our customers do not submit multiple support requests to avoid unnecessary confusion.<br/>Received it from support staff, that's a fucken joke. After more than a week of downtime and no words from the company. Am I suppose to just wait and do nothing!? They are saying you can't provide more details to your original request and they don't want you to create more ticket, which is the only way to communicate with support. WTF! I am moving my domains to someone else!
