<p>I like stikipad, but I am glad when I was deciding which wiki to use I didn't go with stikipad.</p>

<p>They are currently down and, according to its users has been down for 2 weeks already. On top of the the owners and support is not there.</p>

<p>I am current playing with porting my wiki pages to Google Site. My experience so far is that the UI is nice, displaying code is a bit of pain until I figure out a better way. Lastly it doesn't seem to be indexed by Google.</p>
