<p>I was so impressed with my Sandisk cruzer micro 512MB because it withstood the test of my daughter's drooling &amp; sucking I decided to get another Sandisk <br/>when I upgrade.</p><p>So I had my eye on the micro 4gb stick for a while, I considered the titanium version, which is stronger (titanium shell) and faster (tho no official stats from Sandisk) but given my old micro was plenty tough I decided it wasn't worth the extra $.</p><p>Today I finally got my new 4gb stick in mailbox, after unpackaging it I immediately noticed it doesn't feel as sturdy as my old micro and is slightly bigger. I thought, that's ok, I don't really need my usb stick to be able to take much force. The new stick's case design is different, the usb connector is retractable so it doesn't need a lid so you won't loose it. </p><p>So far I haven't really used it, I erased the stick using OS X Disk Utility to get rid of the crap that came with it but I can't seem to get rid of the U3 System which is a feature that only applies on windows. I knew about that before I bought it, what I didn't realise is that to remove U3 you have to do it in windows, argh~~~~ I just want to use it as a storage device so no U3 for me. I guess I'll have to wait until I get to work tomorrow to be able to uninstall it. Then that got me thinking.... what if my workplace doesn't have windows? Then I'll have to go thru more hassle to get rid of U3! humm... I am going to take that into consideration for my next usb flash drive. </p>
