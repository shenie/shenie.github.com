<p>I have been trying to find good restaurant for steak or seafood since I got to Wellington.</p>

<p>I have found a <a href="http://www.dogandbone.co.nz/">couple</a> <a href="http://www.crazyhorsethesteakhouse.co.nz/">of</a> steakhouses that looks good that I will be going soonish. But so far haven't found anything for seafood :(</p>

<p>Overall it has been quite difficult to find good restaurants to eat in Wellington comparing to Sydney. If I google <a href="http://tinyurl.com/28m46y">seafood restaurant sydney</a> I can see Doyles and Nick's results in the first page, whereas google the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yw86gc">same thing for Wellington</a> I don't get much to go on :(</p>

<p>I will keep trying I will get my seafood fix sooner or later. Fingers crossed.</p>
