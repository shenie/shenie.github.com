<p>One of the reason I like Ruby community is the friendliness.</p>

<p>But a few comments on this <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6k6ekm">post</a> is not a demonstration of that friendliness. I am sure Dan totally gets the concepts and he wrote a followup <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5oj4me">post</a> about it. I am just interested to see if the idiotic comments come back.</p>
