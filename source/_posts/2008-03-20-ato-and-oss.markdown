<p>&#8220;<a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/software/soa/ATO-avoids-open-source-due-to-security-concerns/0,130061733,339286850,00.htm">All software has bugs, no matter what the licence</a>&#8221;</p>

<p>That reminded me how naive one of the developer I was in the meeting claiming that there are no bugs in their system. LOL.</p>

<p>Even stranger is that the solution architect asking us to trust the data coming to our interface because the it has been validated by 3 layers before getting to our interface.</p>

<p>I don't care how many layers it has been through, applications are responsible for anything it commits to its database. Trust no one unless you want crap data going into the system.</p>
