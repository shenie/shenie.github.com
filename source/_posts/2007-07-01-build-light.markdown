<p>I like lava lamp, they look nice as build lights but they are more of a hassle to setup (especially in OZ since all the plugs and sockets you get from the US is different) or they are against workplace health &amp; safety policies. </p><p>But more importantly I always thought all we need for build light is just a spare PC and monitor. Check out <a href="http://build-o-matic.sourceforge.net/">build-o-matic</a> and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/team-piazza/">team-piazza</a> (thanks to <a href="http://nat.truemesh.com/archives/000696.html">Nat</a>).  Pity neither of them works at my current workplace :(</p>
