<p>I seriously considered changing my current rss reader (google reader) because it is blocked at my current job. I was going to get NetNewsWire for it's offline capability and ability to sync to NewsGator online so I could read at work. The idea was that I get a responsive client app at home and online reader that is synced up to my client.<br/><br/>But after I trialing it for some time, it really didn't gel with me. I am still much better at keeping up with my subscriptions in google reader than NNW so I've decided against buying it.<br/><br/>Other reasons why I decided against buying NNW are:<br/></p><ul><li>I already have lots of things I can do on the train, coding, writing, watching screencasts</li><li>It doesn't look too good if I read feeds at work</li></ul>
