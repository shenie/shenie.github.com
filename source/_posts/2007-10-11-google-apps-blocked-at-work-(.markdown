<p>I've been using google reader for a while and it works well for me. But unfortunately my current work place is blocking access to google reader, as well as gmail. I suspect they block most if not all of the google apps. Now I can understand why they would want to block gmail, whether it is actually serving the purpose that it was intended is another story. But blocking google reader!?!? Sure it is possible to publish your email as feeds so you can read it in reader if work only blocks gmail but come on, if someone who really want to read email from any non-work a/c's they'll find a way and it won't be hard at all. But now I lost access to google reader at work I'm finding it hard to have the energy to keep up with all the stuff I read due to long working hours, family &amp; personal work commitments. I hope I'll find a way soon, as I enjoy reading and keeping up with the industry and I consider it as part of this profession.</p>
