<p>I am interested in wiki. So when I saw the new Merb wiki I naturally wanted to <a href="http://github.com/meekish/collective">check it out</a>. One problem, it's on github and I don't have git yet....</p>

<p>So I finally got off my lazy butt and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4s5k8v">installed git</a>. The process was painless. Now I am all gitified to version 1.5.5. Yeeeha gitty up~~</p>
