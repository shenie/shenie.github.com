<p>I actually looked to get started git a while ago. Even got myself a <a href="http://github.com/shenie">github repos</a> but I couldn't be bothered to install git back then.</p>

<p>Fast forward to now, it is still not as easy as I would like but I can deal with it.</p>

<p>The main reason I want to get git is to make it easier to stay on edge rails.</p>

<p>I haven't felt that I really need distributed SCM. With no experiences with using DSCM I am not ruling it out. Just need to find time to get to try it out.</p>
