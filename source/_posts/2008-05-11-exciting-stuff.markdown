<p>Checkout Nick's <a href="http://blog.nicksieger.com/articles/2008/05/08/javaone-slides">JavaOne presso</a> and play with <a href="http://caldersphere.rubyforge.org/warbler/">Warbler</a>. I just did and it is very cool. It will create a lot of combination of possibilities on something I plan to present to the <a href="http://fineos.com/">company</a> I work for.</p>
