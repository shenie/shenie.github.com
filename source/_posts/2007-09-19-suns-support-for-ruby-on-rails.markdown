<p>I got the link to a <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/presentations/railsconfeurope07/re7_craigrmcclanahan.pdf">presentation</a> by Sun's Craig McClanahan from <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/posts/11-sun-surprises-at-railsconf-europe-2007">this post</a>.</p><p><br/>The presentation, as DHH pointed out, shows Sun's commitment to RoR but what I enjoyed the most was Craig's views on application trends and that we should be treating applications as mashups and think about exposing them as REST as much as we can.Â </p>
