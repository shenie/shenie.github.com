<p>By default Git uses less as a pager. That is very cool because to look at logs you no longer have to pipe the output to less yourself.
But something didn't work very well for me until I finally couldn't take it anymore. The problem was that for some reason my Git output in less is displaying weird chars that looks like ESC at beginning of lines.
I found the culprit to be one of my env variable LESS=-i, which makes search in less case-insensitive. It's all good after it's taken out :)</p>
