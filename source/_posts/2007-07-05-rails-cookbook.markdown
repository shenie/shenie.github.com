<p>I am proud to have been a technical reviewer and contributor to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rails-Cookbook-Cookbooks-OReilly-Orsini/dp/0596527314">Rails Cookbook</a> by <a href="http://blog.tupleshop.com/">Rob Orsini</a>. It was a valuable experience for me and I learned a lot while reviewing the book and sharing ideas with fellow contributors.</p>
