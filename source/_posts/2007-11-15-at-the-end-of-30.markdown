<p>After a couple of year without doing sports like before, I realised I needed to change my lifestyle as my health was not looking good.</p>

<p>Also, suddenly I have a interest in getting our finance on track. We were doing ok, but I wanted to do more than ok, I wanted to be more active. Especially reading what other people have done, I only regret not starting early.
So my partner and I finally decided to get some professional help.</p>

<p>I guess you could say 30 yo was quite a turning point for me. Youth is no longer with me, time is never enough. sigh.... Lots of pebbles to take care of <em>wink</em> <em>wink</em> and have to re-adjust my lifestyle. But it's all good, K is so damn cute :)</p>
