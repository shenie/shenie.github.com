<p>Firefox is a memory hog and gets slower as soon as I have a few tabs and google apps opened.</p>

<p>Time to give Safari another try, especially the version 3 improve the &#8216;Find' function. It used to be a pop-up dialog to enter search text, which annoys me but now it's similar to how Firefox does &#8216;Find' :)</p>
