<p>If the Groovy framework Grails <a href="http://www.nabble.com/Groovy-on-Rails-is-no-more-%28kind-of%29-t1369271.html">wasn't</a> allowed to use &#8216;on rails' suffix then wouldn't that apply to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spring-on-rails/">Spring on Rails</a>? I wonder if &amp; when DHH will make the request and what the new name will be? Sails? Srails?</p>
