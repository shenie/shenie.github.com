<p>For the last 2 weeks, I went back to use Eclipse and noted down <a href="http://wiki.shenie.info/#%5B%5BWhat%20I%20miss%20IntelliJ%20in%20Eclipse%5D%5D">what I missed</a> most in Eclipse from IntelliJ IDEA. I was going to keep using it a bit longer but today when I had to figure out how stuff works at work I just couldn't do it in Eclipse as fast as I could with IDEA so I've decided to activate IDEA again.</p><p>So overall, using Eclipse to code is fine but using it to learn or analyse an obscure app is just painful. </p>
